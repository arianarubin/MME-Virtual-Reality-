###Virtual Reality Research

1. 1827
- first photograph was taken
- ideas of virtual reality started to spring

2. 1838
- first stereoscope was invented
- used twin mirrors to project a single image

3. 1838-today
- stereoscope developed into the "View-Master"
- still produced today

4. 1957
- Morton Heilig (filmmaker) invented the Sensorama, a large booth-like machine
- intended to combine multiple technologies to give one to four people the illusion of being in fully 3D immersive world
- Complete with smell, stereo sound, vibrations, and atmospheric effects (like 4D, wind in hair)

5. 1960
- Morton Heilig honed idea into patent for the world's first head-mounted display
- promising stereoscopic 3D images, wide vision, true stereo sound

6. 1965
- inventor Ivan Sutherland created the "head-mounted device"
- He said it would "serve as a 'window into a virtual world.'"
- Connected to a stereoscopic display from a computer program depicting simple virtual wireframe shapes
- Changed perspective as user moved his/her head
- birth of "augmented reality"

7. 1978
- MIT developed a virtual reality-like Aspen Movie Map take on Google Street View with help from DARPA
-  used photographs taken from a car driving through Aspen, Colorado
-Gave the user an interactive first-person journey around the city


8. 1980
- Term virtual reality first appeared
- Jaron Lanier founded VPL research
- Began to develop goggles and gloves
- The cave

9. mid-1980's
- At NASA Ames Research Center, the Virtual Interface Environment Workstation (VIEW) combined the head-mounted device and gloves together to create a haptic interaction

10. 1991
- SEGA attempted to launch a VR headset, development started or it at this time

11. 2010
