1. This article discusses the history of virtual reality, and talks about how technology from 150 years ago relates to the way virtual reality works today.  In the 19th century, the London Stereoscopic Company created what seemed to be a headset-like device which combined photographs that were taken a fraction of a second apart.  This was the first iteration of VR.

2. This article also discusses the history of virtual reality.  It states that VR goes back to the early 1800s, dating back to the invention of photography. In 1838, the first stereoscope was invented.  It used twin mirrors to project a single image.  This developed into the View-Master which was patented in 1939 and is still produced today.  However, the term "virtual reality" was first used in the mid-1980s when research began to develop on goggles, gloves, and headsets.  This experience is what Jaron Lanier called "virtual reality."
