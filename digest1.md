3. This article talks about how virtual reality has helped prepare athletes for the winter olympics of 2018.  The U.S. alpine skiing team used virtual reality technology to allow the competitors to memorize the hills in Pyeongchang as well as taking hundreds of virtual runs down faster and tricky courses.  This way, the skiers would be more familiar with the mountain and have months of practice instead of just training a couple of days before the competition.
