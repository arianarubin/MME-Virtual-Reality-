Bias Report: Virtual Reality
	Virtual reality is a new technology that is taking over the modern world.  While virtual reality is used for more than just fun, such as therapy and education, the real target for virtual reality is gamers.  Gaming has become a huge platform for many people, and is just as competitive and popular as sports.  Gaming competitions are widely spread throughout the world and has become a way for people to come together with the same interests.  While virtual reality is being used for many different ideas and purposes, it clearly targets gamers.  Virtual reality is a gaming system that allows one to play many different video games such as The Lab, The London Heist, Doom VFR, and much more.  
	In addition, virtual reality is clearly biased towards people who can see, and it rejects people who are blind.  With or without the extra accessories, such as gloves, virtual reality is essentially a headset.  If you cannot see, then you cannot use virtual reality.  The whole point of using virtual reality is to insert yourself into a 3-dimensional world, so no matter where you look, you can see something completely different.  People who are blind are clearly at a disadvantage because they would not be able to experience being in a different world, considering they cannot see.   
	In addition, virtual reality is also biased towards millennials and younger people.  People of older generations, the few that can, can barely use iPhones.  How are they supposed to use virtual reality, a complex headset with accessories, if they cannot even use a smartphone correctly?  Virtual reality is the next step towards the future, not the past.
