This article talks about how virtual reality is being used to help fight against opioid addiction.  Using virtual reality helps tap into the source of the addition and transports them into a safe place where they can fight the addiction.  This works because people who use substances do it to regulate their emotions, so virtual reality can easily regulate their emotions as a replacement. Also, the patients talk to their therapists in the VR world in the form of an avatar.  How this works is that there is a real person behind the avatar.  The fact that you can be transported into a room surrounded by other people is very powerful and you get the needed social support.
