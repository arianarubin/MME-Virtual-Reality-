1. The company Qualcomm has designed a new virtual reality headset that feature its latest chip, the Snapdragon 845.  Its purpose it to provide a starting point so that other manufacturers can develop their own headset.  Companies like Google, Facebook, and HTC Vive have used Snapdragon 835 as a reference.  In addition,  Qualcomm is trying to put its chips on mobile (literally) so one does not have to pay for an expensive PC set up.

2. Virtual reality is now being used as a virtual airline hub.  People can save time and money while flying first class without leaving the ground.  Passengers on First Airlines flights with an official boarding pass can have access to a VR headset.  They can use them to fly anywhere they want which seems like a good way to pass time on a plane.
