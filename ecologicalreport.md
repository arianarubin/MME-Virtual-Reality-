Technological Ecology Report: Virtual Reality

  Virtual Reality is a new technology that is not only taking over gaming, but also education, therapy, training, and much more.  This system has made a huge positive impact on us both socially and culturally.  Virtual reality can be used as a way to communicate with other by chatting.  VRChat is a program through VR that lets you create virtual worlds and share them with other people.  Also, Facebook has created its own virtual reality chat room.  This way, you can talk to someone else with your virtual characters, even if you are in a completely different place.  You are able to see each otherâ€™s movements as well, such as nodding your head or moving your arms.  It is an illusion to seem as if you are in the same room talking.  This makes it easier to contact people far away.  Furthermore, you can use VR to contact others through chatting with certain games.  Some games give you the option to chat with other gamers and play with others across the world.  
	In addition, virtual reality is being brought into the public to help improve our lives with things such as education, therapy, and training.  Virtual reality is being brought into schools to improve certain experiences.  For example, one high school class used virtual reality to virtually travel to upstate New York and go to a farm to observe farm animals.  The experience was just as real as being there in person, and it saved them a trip.  It is a new way to learn and educate people in school that is more engaging and that offers various ways of interaction.  Virtual reality is also being used to train people for jobs, sports, and other activities.  The USA winter Olympics skiing alpine team used virtual reality to practice skiing down the mountain in Korea while still being in the United States.  In addition, an office work company has been using VR to train their new employees for the job.  Virtual reality is clearly having a positive effect on us socially and culturally, and is a step towards future evolution.
